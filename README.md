# Composite Monsters

Supporting materials for "Explaining Mythical Composite Monsters in a Global Cross-Cultural Sample"

Composite beings ("monsters") are special kinds of mythical creatures that are comprised of a mix of different anatomical forms. There are several claims for why they appear in the religions and folklore of many societies, including claims that they are found universally. We attempt to identify the presence of composite monsters in the lore of a global sample of societies in order to test these claims. We find that they are not universal, and their presence or absence co-varies with social stratification and transport technology. This supports hypotheses that the cultural evolution of composite monsters is driven by concerns with social distinctions within societies as well as interest in distant cultures.
