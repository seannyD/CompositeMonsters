Then she begged him to leave her alone until she should call him, saying that she wanted to transform herself. She painted herself and turned into a jaguar except that from the shoulders up she remained human . . . She thus continued to bring game to the hut, but would not permit him to approach her. One day her head, too, turned into a jaguar's; now she was a beast all over."""
