SCCS139,Kutenai,xd1205,kute1249,Kutenai,,SCCS1734,10,no market exchange outside of local community,1890,Lower or eastern branch,"turneyhigh1941 [195]: The subjects of Value and Distribution cannot be discussed with any clarity at this date. Value in the sense of the power of a good to satisfy human needs was there, but utility measured in the terms of other goods, that is, in Price, is hard to understand, since Kutenai economics had the flaws inherent in a barter economy. They did trade, and where there is trade there may be Price, unless this trading were covered with ceremonial and the concept of out-gifting. One would have had to have seen the culture as a going concern to speak definitely of Exchange Value and Price. The trade element was weakly, or perhaps fairly well developed, but the prestige elements overshadowed it. The rich were supposed to suffer in internal trade. It was a point of honour with them. In this they merely agreed with the Northern Plateau as a whole. Whatever the theoretical implications might be, a rich man sought to trade with a poor man and deliberately gave him the best of the bargain. Persons of the same degree of prosperity would often barter frankly, however, each trying to get the best of the exchange. A great deal of goods passed not only in frank trade but in the ordinary gift exchange of the Northern Plateau.

turneyhigh1941 [20]: This region was first explored by David Thompson, who was sent out by the Northwest Company in 1808. The first effective white contact, then, was with the fur trade which, despite its faults, can most favorably be compared with Indian contact with miner, cowboy, and politician. The company soon sent Finn McDonald to build a trading post at Kootenai Falls, Montana. Later, the Hudson's Bay Company sent out a number of Iroquois to teach the northwest Plateau Indians the technique and economics of the fur trade. Since these Iroquois were already Christians, the Kutenai were prepared by them to receive the missionaries. This Iroquois proselyting, coupled with the high quality of the early Catholic missionaries, kept the Kutenai from feeling the worst effects of precipitous and purblind, if enthusiastic, evangelization.

turneyhigh1941 [196]: External trade with friendly tribes was described under Hospitality, and really falls more under that concept than under trade. It is true that a lavish gift expended on a stranger or outsider would be returned in kind, so that in the end much property exchanged even though it was considered gifting rather than trade. Much gifting was made with chiefs of friendly tribes, but since this was intermittent and the return element was not strong, it fell more under diplomacy than trade.

chamberlain1892 [571]: Much of the food supply of the Kootenays is now purchased. They are very fond of such sweet things as sugar, sweet-meats, jellies, and preserves.

They regarded the post as a source of provender and of manufactured goods. The influence of the Indian agent seemed to be directly proportional to his supply of gifts. He was careful to give the lion's share of these to the chief and the members of his lineage, so that even if the community as a whole did not feel warmly towards him at a particular time, he could be certain that its most influential people would not side against him.

mayburylewis1967 [201]: Nowhere is this characteristic of his office brought more clearly when he officiates at a ceremonial food distribution. Shavante usually take large kills to their own households, where first claim on the meat is the prerogative of the co-resident families. Hunks are meanwhile dispatched to relatives who are mother's brother or sister's child to both the killer and his wife and to the killer's parents' household. After these shares have been distributed, the killer has no further specific obligations towards his relatives. Nevertheless he may not decently refuse them if they ask for some of the meat, and they invariably come flocking, or at least send their children over, when they see a successful hunter returning. Shavante are therefore accustomed to making a lightning distribution of their spoils among the members of their household and their close kin, so that when others come to ask for some they can be told that it is all gone, or at the most given a nominal share.

SCCS31,Shilluk,xd380,shil1265,Shilluk,Nilotic,SCCS1734,10,no market exchange outside of local community,,Kingdom,"butt1952b [40]: Trade is not very important among the Nilotes as, in general, they feel little need for other people's products. Most of the tribal groups consider cattle as wealth and, as Evans-Pritchard has written about the Nuer, they have nothing to trade except their cattle and all they desire is more cattle. The Lango do exchange surplus produce and ivory for cattle with Arab traders. Internally, the Nilotes are too self-sufficient for there to be more than an occasional exchange of articles. Some people make better pots, baskets and so forth than others, while only smiths can provide iron objects. People who want things from them either ask in the name of kinship or friendship or give some equivalent in the form of millet or garden produce in exchange. There is no third person acting as intermediary. There is little inequality of wealth, for these is not object in acquiring more than can be used by family. There may be some exchange of goods between the Nilotic groups bordering on each other. The Jo-Luo, being superior iron-workers, supply the Dinka with spear-heads. The Anuak supply their neighbours with canoes. All this exchange is very elementary and scanty and it may be said that, apart from a limited exchange of material goods among themselves, the concept of trade scarcely exists among the Nilotes.

The Aleuts do not trade in person, but always through a reliable agent or clerk who is called taouianakh, who is chosen from among the young Aleuts.

The clerk enters the barabara and says, ""This is for sale."" But he does not reveal the name of the owner even if the article is known to belong to him. The prospective buyer asks what is demanded for it and the clerk answers. The buyer having examined the article keeps it with himself and sends by the clerk to the seller tobacco or anything else that he too may consider extra or totally unnecessary.

But beyond the circle of kinsmen and village-mates there was formerly little economic co-operation. Each village and kinship group was largely self-sufficient, buying from outside little save iron spears and hoes, medicines, salt, cosmetics, and brass or copper wire for ornament.

wilson1951b [61]: The need for iron goods and for medicines therefore took men out of their own villages and made links with other villages, often in other chiefdoms. Some at least of the iron ore which the smith smelted was obtaind from the distant Kinga mountains outside the Nyakyusa area all together (...) and many medicines came from the Kinga or Sangu.

The details of this trade will be discussed when we come to consider the wider relations of the Nykyusa: here we are only concerned to show that though villagers were dependent on outsiders for a little iron and salt, together with some medicines and ornaments, the bulk of the trade remained very small - salt and iron were extremely scarce - and economic relations beyond the village and kinship group were tenous.

This prevents anything in the nature of inter-island trade on a large scale so that the Tikopia are forced to rely wholly for their immediate subsistence on their own productive efforts. Such exchange with other native communities as can take place is sporadic, and minute for the economy as a whole. It consists in the rare barter of turmeric and food for a few manufactured products such as bows and arrows or turtle-shell ornaments from Vanikoro and other islands to the north-west. There is no importation of food. Much more important are the infrequent calls of European vessels which during the last century have enabled the Tikopia to change and amplify their technical equipment by the acquisistion of steel tools.

Trade in spirits has at all times been strictly forbidden, but in the Kolyma country it forms one of the important items in the Russian dealings with the Chukchee.

bogoras1901b [61]: Since the year 1848, and especially after the purchase of Alaska, American whalers resorting to these waters started a trade on both shores of Bering Sea. In the beginning, the articles they sold were chiefly cheap rum, rifles and ammunition. Afterwards were added all kinds of wares needed by the natives, - flour, biscuits, granulated sugar, black molasses, drilling and muslin, hardware and cutlery, beads, etc. They took in return chiefly whalebone, making enormous profits, since the natives had large stores of it for which they had no use except to make lashings and to shoe their sledge-bottoms. It is curious that Russian traders, even at present, care little for whalebone. The trade in spirits has somewhat decreased in the last few years ...

bogoras1901b [97]: With the coming of American whalers, however, Eskimo traders came into possession of so many things necessary or tempting to the Reindeer people, that they could no longer be despised. With their increased trading capacity, their demand for Chukcheee reindeer is much greater than ever. Every fall the squadron of Indian Point skin boats and whale-boats returns from St. Lawrence Bay or from Holy Cross Bay, where the Reindeer people are numerous, deeply laden with skins and meat, part of which is bartered off to the Eskimo of St. Lawrence Island for whale-skin and blubber.

In the Reindeer branch of the Chukchee, a man more active than the others, though oftentimes not over-attentive to his herd of reindeer, of which he has but comparatively few, will want to go to the seashore for barter. ...

In the late eighteenth century, after the Europeans had visited the Tlingit villages along the Alaska panhandle, these connections became intensified since the coastal Indians, including both Tlingit and Tahltan, became middlemen in the fur trade between the Europeans and the more interior groups. Two Tlingit tribes, the Taku and Stikine Indians, from their geographical position and reported evidence, may be assumed to have maintained such relations with the Kaska (...) Furthest north were the Taku people, occupying the area around Taku Bay and lower Taku River. Krause asserts that they went up the Taku River and across the high passes of the Cordillera toward the headwaters of the Yukon River, where they traded with local Indians. The headwaters of the Taku are about thirty miles east of Teslin Lake, at present a Taku Indian village, which adjoins the territory of the Upper Liard Indians. According to Lees numerous trails lead into the Teslin Lake area from the Pacific Coast and a 150 mile trail runs from Teslin Indian village to the Upper Liard area [pinpoint locality]. To the south the Stikine, or Stakhin, people utilized the Stikine River to carry on "" a lively trade with the Indians of the interior.""

The only possible truth in this statement, which clearly illustrates the contempt of the Eskimo for the Eyak, may be that the Eyak sometimes bought such marine products as seal oil or whale oil from the Eskimo, who were certainly more adept in sea-mammal hunting.

In addition, they traded for pottery, basketry, pigments, rabbitskins and rabbitskin blankets and acorns. In exchange they provided lake products including fish, tule mats, salt from salt grass and shell ""money"" they manufactured from shells secured in trade. That the lake resources were important is indicated by the fact that, although some Yokuts' neighbors were allowed to visit the lake themselves, trade with westerners was carried on at a distance from the lake apparently in part with the intention of preventing them from learning the techniques of securing the products.

Traditionally, exchange among the Yanoama consists of giving and receiving gifts. The ultimate governor in these exchanges is reciprocity - a reciprocity gauged to the Yanoama value system, without fixed equivalents. Response need not be immediate, since the reciprocal act, or acts, can be postponed for lenghty periods of time. Requests for gifts are frequently made with a formal chang in which something specific, such as a machete, is requested by a man of his close kinsman. This gesture has been interpreted by non-Yanoama as begging. When such a formal request is made, it is almost impossible to refuse.
Much gift giving these days involves trade goods - manufactured items, such as steel tools, glass beads, and metal pots - that are exotic to Yanoama material culture.

A very large portion of every Saramaka man's life is devoted to the accumulation of imported goods, and because there has been no tradition of barter or purchase in Saramaka, the subsequent distribution (and sometimes redistribution) of these goods has been intimately tied into social life, both reflecting and maintaining the entire range of social relationships.

Objects of every description, household implements, ornaments, musical instruments, ceremonial objects, plants, pets, and magical substances are in constant circulation from tribe to tribe, from sib to sib. Indians who are in contact with the trading centers of Columbians and Brazilians are often middlemen, pumping manufactured goods into the stream of trade - cloth, salt, fishbooks, guns, machetes, as well as cheap ornaments. There are at least three kinds of trade. One, with the whites, is commercial and is of increasing importance. A second is intertribal, in which specialties are exchanged. Each tribe has its recognized expertness and its products are sought after. The third, intertribal, is less economic and more in the nature of social exchange in which people acquire objects they can readily make for themselves.

(...) Of a harmless nature, on the other hand, has been the trade which the Jibaros on the Upano, Santiago, and Morona have carried on with the mestizos of Macas, who receive all their salt from the Jibaros, as well as such things as deer's flesh, copal, blowguns, etc. The Jibaros of these regions in return receive swine and fowls, guns, powder, knives, axes, and linen chiefly from Macas. Among themselves the different Jibaro sub-tribes mainly barter blowguns, arrow-poison, and arrows - which, as we have seen, must be made of a special kind of palm not obtainable everywhere - as well as hunting dogs and salt. Between the Indians of the mission of Canelos and the savage Jibaros a friedndly barter is carried on which contrasts favourably with the hostility generally prevailing between them in former times.

harner1972 [125]: With conflict and violence common, and lacking any corporate kinship groups to provide security, the Jivaro create social bonds by making ""friends"" (amigri) in a formalized manner through the exchange of trade goods. Such amigri pairs, or trading partnerships, constitute the strongest male social units within the same generation. These partners become mutually obligated to one another to a degree exceeding the obligations of brothers, or even fathers and sons, to become ""friends"" in order to formalize their sense of mutual obligation to one another. While trading partners commonly live in different neighborhoods, many amigri dwell in the same neighborhood, and sometimes even in the same house.

harner1972 [126]: The relationship between a trading partner and his neighbors who are not his formal amigri is a key aspect of the system. A man becomes an amigri not to accumulate and hoard wealth, but to dispense it in his neighborhood, to gain prestige and obligations. The distribution of these goods locally is normally done piecemeal as the trading partner's relatives and others ask him for them. Informants, in sying that a man becomes an amigri ""so that people will like him"", explicitly recognize that the main purpose of being a trading partner, and of distributing the goods obtained thereby, is to acquire friends. The people who receive goods from a partner become morally obligated to him until they reciprocate with either an equivalent amount of goods or with services, the latter usually in the form of aid in the trading partner's social disputes and feuds.

harner1972 [130]: In actual practice, trading partners do not keep a strict accounting of transactions. Since a variety of valuables is exchanged by two ""friends"" at one time and since the Jivaro do not value numeration, the exchange is often slightly uneven. In terms of Jivaroan morality, however, it is apparently unthinkable that a ""friend"" would constistently attempt to take advantage of his partner in such transactions. To do so would jeopardize the continuance of the amigri relationship, and possibly the obligation of the host partner to protect the life of his partner against any local enemies.

The buyers of the bulk farm products, which then were offered for sale in limited quantities in the villages, also were almost entirely non-Egyptian.
harris1957 [240]: Egypt's city bazaars resemble those found elsewhere in the Middle East, but under the impact of heavier and longer-continued western influence they have undergone more change and are less the focus of urban trade than those in other countries in the area. The Egyptian bazaars, to an ever-increasing extent, are supplying goods and provisions for a ""westernized"" population.

dunnanddunn1967 [123]: The effect of such waste and inefficiency on the diet of the Russian peasant is fairly obvious. If he grows vegetables and fruits on his private plot but needs money, he will be tempted to sell his yield (however slight) to the state. Often, however, the state cannot meet the price of produce on the open market, and the peasant will have to take his vegetables and fruits to the city for sale. The Western traveler, accustomed to voluminous baggage, will be amused at the dimensions of this trade. In 1964, when leaving Moscow by plane for the Caucasus and when returning, we saw Soviet citizens with bags and sacks of apples, cabbages, and melons, intended either for sale or in payment for services.

In most parts of Outer Mongolia there were only five types of local group.

vreeland1954 [30/31]: Like most herdsmen, the Mongols were dependent on trade for a series of commodities, some of which they could not extract from their animals or local environment, or could not make themselves, and some of which they preferred to local products and manufactures. These commodities ranged from the more essential requirements of every day living to luxury items brought primarily by persons whose position in the society demanded a certain amount of display.
The items which the Mongols bought, mostly from Chinese, are listed below:
Food and Drink: Tea, Noodles, Millet, Wheat flour, Sugar, Wine; Dried fruits, Cakes
Dry Goods: Cloth - cotton and silk, Needles and thread, Loose hemp and hemp rope, Porcelain dishware, Metal kitchen utensils, Boots, Silk scarves, Saddles, Metal tools, Bar iron, Tobacco,Pipes, and Pipe parts [The has another layout than in the original source]

freeman1970 [202]: If it happens that the previous season has been a bad one, many bilek-families will have by this time exhausted their own stocks of padi [rice] and be living on rice purchased from other Iban or from Chinese traders (...)

freeman1970 [271-272]: Each year as the time of harvest approaches, great interest is taken in the crops other families have produced, and even before the final storing (besimpan) takes place the identity of those bileks with an abundance of padi is well known throughout the long-house. Before long the news travels to neighbouring communities, and within a few weeks of the harvest a bilek-family with a large surplus is likely to find itself the quarry of kith and kin who have suffered poor crops and are seeking additional padi to meet their requirements. Sometimes importunate relatives will come from long-houses twenty and more miles away in an attempt to acquire grain, or to 'madi' - as the Iban term it.
Interestingly enough, two quite distinct standards are observed in disposing of padi: one for kin and other Iban, and another for Chinese or Malay traders. Occasionally grain is given to close relatives, but always on the general understanding that it will be repaid when conditions permit. To give padi in this way is - as the Iban put it - 'equivalent to selling' ('itong di jual'). It is far more usual, however, for a price to be charged, even to near kin. This price varies slightly from community to community, but at Rumah Nyala in 1950, it was $1 for 5 gantangs of padi, or onefifth of the ruling market price. To dispose of grain at this rate is to observe the adat lama - the old custom of the Iban. If padi was sold to Chinese traders the price of $1 per gantang was followed. In contrast, husked rice (brau) was sold to Iban and Chinese alike at the standard market price (in 1950) of $2 per gantang.

The intertribal trade, from the coast of New Guinea into unexplored interior.

pospisil1963a [335]: Because of the differences in environment (topography, elevation, etc.), in natural resources, and in regional cultural emphases on production of certain types of commodities, the interegional trade carries, over long distances, a greater variety of goods than its intraregional counterpart.

pospisil1963b [24]: In their trading Kapauku do not limit themselves to partners of their own tribe. Indeed, the Kamu Valley constitutes but a segment in a chain of intertribal trade that starts in the south at the Mimika coast of New Guinea and continues through the Kapauku territory into the interior, at least as far as the Baliem Valley, or even farther. The whole intertribal trade resembles a chain reaction in which traders from many regions and tribes participate by exchanging their commodities, carrying the newly acquired ones for a relatively short distance and trading them again for other goods to their neighbors on the other side of their territory.
